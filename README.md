# hangman

Hangman made in python; the age old game about guessing a random word with a limited number of guesses.

The rules of the game are:

- maximum limit for guesses.
- player is notified about the remaining number of guesses.
- player inputs their guesses.

A separate text file stores the words or short phrases and a random word is selected.
